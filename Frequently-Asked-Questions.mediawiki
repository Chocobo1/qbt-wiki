== Is it legal to use qBittorrent? ==
qBittorrent is a ''Peer to Peer'' (P2P) file sharing software. Although the software is perfectly legal, it may be illegal to download copyrighted content with this software, depending on the law in your country.

== Why use qBittorrent instead of another client? ==
A lot of other BitTorrent clients exist but qBittorrent has several advantages: 
* It is a Free Software (you can see the code and see what qBittorrent is doing).
* It is the closest open-source equivalent to the extremely popular (and Windows only) BitTorrent client: [http://www.utorrent.com µTorrent].  
* Its development team is very active and friendly.
* It is stable and it has a low footprint, whilst providing all the features you may need.
* It uses the high-tech [http://libtorrent.org/ libtorrent (Rasterbar)] library, which means greater download and upload speed as well as excellent support of the latest features of the BitTorrent protocol.
* It is easy to use and all of its features are well documented.
* It is an international program, supporting Unicode and containing translations into more than 25 languages

== My menu icons in qBittorrent are gone, why? ==
You are probably using GNOME ≥ 2.28. By default, this window manager is no longer displaying menu icons. You can change this behavior by issuing the following two commands in a terminal:
 gconftool-2 --type boolean --set /desktop/gnome/interface/buttons_have_icons true
 gconftool-2 --type boolean --set /desktop/gnome/interface/menus_have_icons true

== Why the name qBittorrent? ==
Well, actually I lacked inspiration on this one. :P qBittorrent is simply a BitTorrent client written using the [http://qt.digia.com/ Qt4 Framework] for its user interface. Most programs developed with Qt4 toolkit use a 'q' as the first letter of their name. The ''qBT'' abbreviation is also commonly used to refer to the qBittorrent client. However, please do '''not''' use the abbreviation ''qtorrent'' since another BiTtorrent client with this name already exists. 

== Where does qBittorrent save its settings? ==
qBittorrent saves its preferences in the ''~/.config/qBittorrent/'' folder.
On OS X the preferences are stored in:

* ''~/Library/Preferences/com.qbittorrent.qBittorrent.plist'' (Actual settings)
* ''~/Library/Preferences/com.qbittorrent.qBittorrent-resume.plist''
* ''~/Library/Preferences/org.qbittorrent.plist''

The .torrent files are stored in:
* ''~/.qBittorrent/'' by qBittorrent < 2.1.0
* ''~/.local/share/data/qBittorrent/'' by qBittorrent ≥ 2.1.0. This is the standard  [http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html XDG] data folder.
* ''%APPDATA%\qBittorrent on Windows.

== How can I reset the preferences to default values in Mac OS X?==

You need to delete the qBittorrent .plist files from  ~/Library/Preferences:

* <tt>~/Library/Preferences/org.qbittorrent.*</tt> 
* <tt>~/Library/Preferences/com.qbittorrent.*</tt>

And then do this to reset the plist cache:

<code>$ killall -u yourusername cfprefsd</code>

Where "yourusername" is your OS X user name.


== I configured qBittorrent to not download some files in a torrent but they still appear on my hard disk, why is that? ==
As you may know, a torrent is split into pieces of equal size that do not take files into consideration. As a consequence, a piece can contain information relative to more than one file and qBittorrent only operates at piece level. Because of this, if two files are adjacent and you choose to download only one of them, it is likely that the filtered one will be partially downloaded and thus appear on the hard-disk.

== Seeding torrents have no priority (i.e. queue position), why? ==
qBittorrent is handling torrent seeding priority by itself in order to optimise sharing and benefit to the swarm as much as possible.

== What do the different colours mean? ==
Grey colour means inactive (include download, upload and check), green colour means active download, orange colour means active upload and red colour means error.

== How do I import my torrents from another Bittorrent client? ==
Most users want to keep the torrents they are downloading or seeding when switching to qBittorrent from another Bittorrent client. This is of course possible and it is quite simple to achieve. Here is how you should proceed:
* Add the *.torrent files corresponding to your torrents to qBittorrent
** '''Deluge''' stores its *.torrent files in ''~/.config/deluge/''
** '''KTorrent''' stores its *.torrent files in ''~/.kde4/share/apps/ktorrent/''
** '''Vuze''' stores its *.torrent files in ''~/.azureus/torrents/''
** '''Transmission''' stores its *.torrent files in ''~/.config/transmission/torrents/''
** '''rTorrent''' stores its *.torrent files in ''~/.session/'' (as a default)
* Edit the download path in the torrent addition dialog and choose the path where the original torrents were being downloaded/seeded.
* For the torrents that are complete, you can select the ''Skip file checking and start seeding immediately'' option in the torrent addition dialog in order to save time and CPU. Basically, qBittorrent will trust that the local files are not corrupt and will start seeding them without rechecking all the files.

== Can I run qBittorrent on a remote computer? Without an X server? ==
Yes and Yes!
qBittorrent can be run on your server and controlled remotely through its Web UI. As a default, the Web UI is running on http://server-ip:8080 (user: admin, password: adminadmin). If your server does not have an X server running, then you will need to disable the qBittorrent graphical user interface at compilation time (≥ v2.1.0 only). Pass --disable-debug parameter to the configure file before compilation to disable the GUI. Instructions on disabling the qBittorrent GUI is available [[Running qBittorrent without X server|here]].

== Is there a firefox addon that can help me send torrents to qBittorrent? ==
Yes there is a great firefox addon called [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bittorrent-webui-120685/ Bit Torrent WebUI+] that can send torrent and magnet links directly to the qBT Web UI server when clicked.
This addon works with many popular WebUI clients including qBittorrent.

== My favorite RSS feed requires cookies, how can I configure qBittorrent to use them? ==
Support for cookies in RSS feeds was added in qBittorrent v2.3.0.

To use feeds that require cookies, you must find the cookie for the site, and extract the UID and pass parameters from it.
* '''Firefox''' users will find their cookies in ''Tools -> Options -> Privacy -> Show Cookies''
* '''Opera''' users will find their cookies in ''Tools -> Advanced -> Cookies''
* '''Internet Explorer''' users will find their cookies in ''%UserProfile%\Cookies''
* Users of other browsers will have to consult their browsers documentation.

Once you have the appropriate information, right click on the RSS feed in qBittorrent and select ''"Manage cookies"''. Then define the same key/values found in your Web browser cookies. For example:
{| border="1"
! Key
! Value
|-
|uid
|1234
|-
|pass
|asdjh12378912y3lk
|}

Not every site uses UID and pass as the cookie variable names and they may include additional variables.
You MUST use the exact variable name and the extra variables they specify. For example, a certain site may use id, password, and secure as its cookie variables.

== What is qBittorrent Peer ID? ==
Each BitTorrent client is identified by a string called Peer ID. This ID is sometimes used by trackers to whitelist only a limited amount of trusted clients. The size of the Peer ID field is '''20 bytes'''.

qBittorrent Peer ID is formatted as follows: -qBXYZ0-<nowiki><</nowiki>12 random bytes<nowiki>></nowiki>
where:
* X is the major version number
* Y is the minor version number
* Z is the bugfix version number (in hexadecimal so that we can go up to 15)

For example, we would have the following Peer IDs for these versions: 
* qBittorrent v2.4.10: '''-qB24A0-<nowiki><</nowiki>12 random bytes<nowiki>></nowiki>'''
* qBittorrent v3.0.2: '''-qB3020-<nowiki><</nowiki>12 random bytes<nowiki>></nowiki>'''
