Hello -Somehow I messed up my UI lock password. I even uninstalled and reinstalled the qtorrent program and still have that same problem. Every time I try to open the program it requires a UI lock password that I must have forgotten and now I cant open the program
Can You Please Help Me? Do you have a phone number I can call for support or help?
Thank You
Ken
