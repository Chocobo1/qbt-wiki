I faced one problem while using qBittorrent today, i.e. How to disable peer exchange, and other options like [DHT], [PeX], [LSD] in qBittorrent? Some how at last I found the answer in some website. 

The solution is:
Click on: Tools>Options>BitTorrent>

Click on and uncheck 'Enable DHT....', 'Enable Peer Exchange (PeX)....', 'Enable Local Peer .......', under "Privacy".

Its done. Then after you can check that all the above three are 'Disabled' in the trackers list of torrents. 

Hope it may be useful to all of you.

Thanking you all.
