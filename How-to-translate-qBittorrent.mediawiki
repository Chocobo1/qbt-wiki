qBittorrent is currently translated into approximately 25 languages but we are still looking for new translators to help us make qBittorrent available into as many languages as possible.

== Languages already supported ==
We are using [https://www.transifex.com/ Transifex] to localize qBittorrent. You can see the current state of the localization by visiting the [https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/qbittorrent/ page of the project].

If you want to help, sign up for free, select the language you want to translate and request to join the translation team.<br>
Once you are accepted as member of the team, you can proceed with the translation.

== Proceed with the translation ==
Transifex provides an easy to use web interface to work on the translation. The only requirement is to be part of the translation team.

You can alternatively work locally using tools such as ''Qt Linguist'' and submit your changes using the web interface or the Transifex client. Make sure your local files are updated before pushing changes or you may override the work of others.

=== Things you need to pay attention to ===
* HTML tags
We tried not to put much html code in the translatable strings but some of them still contain some html tags in them. If it is the case, please recopy the html tags in the translation ''as is'' and translate the rest of the string. the html '''MUST''' be present in the translation and at the same location.<br><br>

* %1, %2, %3...
These were introduced to give the translator more flexibility. They must appear ''as is'' in the translated string but their location ''can'' change (this is the point). Some languages require that some words are moved in the sentence in order to be understandable. (i.e: "Finished to download %1." can be translated in french as "Le téléchargement de %1 est terminé.")<br><br>

* Keyboard shotcuts: ''&''
They should be present in the translation too. Just recopy them at the same location.<br><br>

* Comments
Sometimes, it may be important to understand to context in order to translate well. This is why I sometimes include comments in the translation files. Refer to refer to ''Context'' in ''More details'' on the online editor.
