# Do you have speed problems?

If so, please do not ask for assistance here, go to the [Official qBittorrent support forum](http://forum.qbittorrent.org) and provide the answers to the following:

## Connection speed:
What your ISP has sold you is irrelevant, to calculate a starting place for settings requires a real time check of bandwidth/speed capability.

### Instructions:

Turn off any and all BitTorrent clients that are running, open [Speedtest.net](http://speedtest.net)  in a browser, run the test(s), then provide a screen shot of the results in your post.

## Version and Operating System

This is essential. Also before asking, please ensure that you are using the latest release for your OS. See [the news page](http://www.qbittorrent.org/news.php) first, as we do not support older versions of qBT
