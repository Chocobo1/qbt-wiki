Hi
I have version v4.0.3 Web UI installed on QNAP TS-451+ and initially it worked well but I now get the above error message in red in the bottom left hand corners and all the download numbers are showing '0'. Sometimes if I refresh the page the message goes away and it shows the various number of downloads etc but this soon changes and the error message reappears.

Has anyone any suggestions.

Thanks
