This page describes how to compile qBittorrent using MSVC 2008 under Windows. This is tested under Windows XP sp2 but it should work the same under any other Windows version. Also it should build fine with MSVC 2010 with minor adjustments. Here the Express Edition of MSVC 2008 was used but the full edition must behave the same.

=== What you will need: ===
* The MSVC 2008 compiler. The Express Edition(free) will do fine.
* A [http://www.perl.org/ Perl language] interpreter. [http://strawberryperl.com/ Strawberry Perl] will do fine. Download version 5.16.1.1 [http://strawberry-perl.googlecode.com/files/strawberry-perl-5.16.1.1-32bit.msi here].
* Latest release of the [http://www.nasm.us/ NASM assembler]. Download version 2.10.5 [http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.10.05/win32/nasm-2.10.05-win32.zip here].
* Latest release of [http://www.openssl.org/ OpenSSL]. Download version 1.0.0c [http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.1c.tar.gz here].
* Latest release of the [http://www.boost.org/ Boost libraries]. Download version 1.51.0 [http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.51.0/boost_1_51_0.7z/download here].
* Latest release of [http://www.rasterbar.com/products/libtorrent/ libtorrent(rasterbar)]. Download version 0.16.3 [https://libtorrent.googlecode.com/files/libtorrent-rasterbar-0.16.3.tar.gz here].
* Latest release of the [http://qt-project.org/ Qt libraries] source. Download version 4.8.3 [http://releases.qt-project.org/qt4/source/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.3.tar.gz here].
* Latest release of [http://www.qbittorrent.org qBittorrent]. Download version 3.0.2 [http://sourceforge.net/projects/qbittorrent/files/qbittorrent/qbittorrent-3.0.2/qbittorrent-3.0.2.tar.xz/download here].
* Latest release of [http://qt-project.org/downloads#qt-creator Qt Creator]. Download version 2.5.2 [http://get.qt.nokia.com/qtcreator/qt-creator-win-opensource-2.5.2.exe here].

Let's assume that the working directory for our compilation will be '''C:\qBittorrent'''

=== Compiling OpenSSL ===
* Make sure you have installed perl and nasm.
* Extract the OpenSSL source inside our working dir.
* Open the MSVC2008 command shell. Start->Programs->Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition->Visual Studio Tools->Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt
* Navigate to the OpenSSL source folder. eg ''cd C:\qBittorrent\openssl-1.0.1c''
* Now we will build a static version of OpenSSL. Issue the following commands:
 perl Configure VC-WIN32 no-shared no-zlib-dynamic threads --prefix=C:\qBittorrent\openssl-1.0.1c\my_build
 ms\do_nasm
 nmake -f ms\nt.mak
 nmake -f ms\nt.mak install
 xcopy /s "my_build\include\*" "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include\*"
 xcopy "my_build\lib\*" "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\lib\*"
The last 2 commands will copy the necessary files to MSVC's directories so OpenSSL can be picked up by libtorrent, asio, qbittorrent and any other program that needs it.
