This how-to will guide you though the compilation of qBittorrent and libtorrent-rasterbar.<br />This guide is written for Ubuntu/Debian, but the process should be similar for other Linux distributions.<br /><br />Only follow this guide if you know what you are doing, and this is what you really want.<br />If you are looking only for the latest version of qBittorrent, just head to the download page and use our PPAs.

== Required dependencies ==
* General required dependencies

* Geoip Database (For peer country resolution, strongly advised)
 sudo apt-get install geoip-database

== Libtorrent ==
[http://libtorrent.org/ Libtorrent] is a library written by Arvid Norberg that qBittorrent depends on. It is necessary to compile and install libtorrent before compiling qBittorrent.

Right now libtorrent-rasterbar-dev is built from the [https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/releases/tag/libtorrent-1_1_1 official tar ball 1.1.1] which is incompatible with current qBittorrent.
You have to compile 1.0.10 from the [https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent repo].

Clone from the repo.
 git clone https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent.git
 cd libtorrent

If you want to use libtorrent 1.0.*. (recommended)
 git checkout RC_1_0
 ./autotool.sh
 ./configure --disable-debug --enable-encryption --with-libgeoip=system

If you want to use libtorrent 1.1.*. (Note 1.1.x series are not officially supported yet and have several [https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/6132 issues].)
 git checkout RC_1_1
 ./autotool.sh
 ./configure --disable-debug --enable-encryption --with-libgeoip=system CXXFLAGS=-std=c++11

If you get a "configure: error: Boost.System library not found.", check if you installed all the above dependencies. <br/>If yes, add --with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu

Now you're ready to compile:
 make clean && make
 sudo make install

For more information on building libtorrent, see [http://www.rasterbar.com/products/libtorrent/building.html libtorrent downloading and building]

== Compiling qBittorrent (with the GUI) ==
First, obtain the qBittorrent source code. Either download and extract a .tar archive from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/qbittorrent/files/qbittorrent/ Sourceforge] or clone this git repo (<code>git clone https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent</code>).
<br />Enter the folder in a new terminal window and run:
 ./configure
 make

'''Note1''': If you're using libtorrent-rasterbar from the 0.16.x series, you also need to pass the "--with-libtorrent-rasterbar0.16" option to configure. qBittorrent v3.3.x has dropped the support of libtorrent 0.16.x.
<br />'''Note2''': If you want to compile with qt4 instead of qt5, you also need to pass the "--with-qt4" option to configure. 

And finally to install qBittorrent:
 sudo make install

That's it! qBittorrent should now be installed. You can now run qBittorrent using the following command:
 qbittorrent

== Compiling qBittorrent (without the GUI; aka qBittorrent-nox aka headless) ==
First, obtain the qBittorrent source code. Either download and extract a .tar archive from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/qbittorrent/files/qbittorrent/ Sourceforge] or clone this git repo (<code>git clone https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent</code>).
<br />Enter the folder in a new terminal window and run:
 ./configure --disable-gui
 make

'''Note1''': If you're using libtorrent-rasterbar from the 0.16.x series, you also need to pass the "--with-libtorrent-rasterbar0.16" option to configure. qBittorrent v3.3.x has dropped the support of libtorrent 0.16.x.
<br />'''Note2''': If you want to compile with qt4 instead of qt5, you also need to pass the "--with-qt4" option to configure.
<br />'''Note3''': If you want to disable ALL authentification on the WebGUI, change some lines as explained here: https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/Disable-authentification-of-webGUI/

And finally to install qBittorrent:
 sudo make install

That's it! qBittorrent-nox should now be installed. You can now run qBittorrent-nox using the following command:
 qbittorrent-nox

Since you disabled the graphical user interface, qBittorrent can only be controlled via its Web UI. If you haven' t disabled authentification, as a default, you can access it from:
 http://localhost:8080
 Username: admin
 Password: adminadmin

A documentation about running qBittorrent without GUI is available [[Running-qBittorrent-without-X-server|here]].
