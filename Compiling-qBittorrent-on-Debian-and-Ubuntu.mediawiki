Only follow this guide if you know what you are doing and this is what you really want.<br />
If you are looking only for the latest version of qBittorrent, just head to the [https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php download page] and use our [https://launchpad.net/~qbittorrent-team/+archive/ubuntu/qbittorrent-stable PPAs].

This how-to will guide you though the compilation of qBittorrent and libtorrent-rasterbar.<br />
This guide is written for Debian/Ubuntu, but the process should be similar for other Debian-derivatives distributions.

== Required dependencies ==
* General required dependencies
 sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config automake libtool git
 sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-random-dev libssl-dev

* Qt libraries
 sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libqt5svg5-dev

* Python (Run time only dependency, for the search engine)
 sudo apt-get install python3

== Libtorrent ==
[http://libtorrent.org/ Libtorrent] is a library written by Arvid Norberg that qBittorrent depends on.<br />
It is necessary to compile and install libtorrent before compiling qBittorrent.

Clone from the repo
 git clone https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent.git
 cd libtorrent

If you want to use libtorrent 1.1.* (Also see: [https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/6132 issue 6132])
 git checkout $(git tag | grep libtorrent-1_1_ | sort -t _ -n -k 3 | tail -n 1)
 ./autotool.sh
 ./configure --disable-debug --enable-encryption --with-libgeoip=system CXXFLAGS=-std=c++11

If you want to use libtorrent 1.0.*
 git checkout $(git tag | grep libtorrent-1_0_ | sort -t _ -n -k 3 | tail -n 1)
 ./autotool.sh
 ./configure --disable-debug --enable-encryption --with-libgeoip=system CXXFLAGS=-std=c++11

If you get a <code>configure: error: Boost.System library not found</code>, check if you installed all the above dependencies.<br/>
If yes, add <code>--with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu</code>

Now you're ready to compile:
 make clean && make -j2
 sudo make install

For more information on building libtorrent, see [http://www.libtorrent.org/building.html libtorrent downloading and building].

== Compiling qBittorrent (with the GUI) ==
First, obtain the qBittorrent source code.<br />
Either download and extract a .tar archive from [https://sourceforge.net/projects/qbittorrent/files/qbittorrent/ Sourceforge] or clone this git repo: <code>git clone https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent</code><br />
Enter the folder in a new terminal window and run:
 ./configure
 make -j2

* Note 1: If you're using libtorrent-rasterbar from the 0.16.x series, you also need to pass the <code>--with-libtorrent-rasterbar0.16</code> option to configure. qBittorrent v3.3.x has dropped the support of libtorrent 0.16.x.
* Note 2: If you want to compile with qt4 instead of qt5, you also need to pass the <code>--with-qt4</code> option to configure.

And finally to install qBittorrent:
 sudo make install

That's it! qBittorrent should now be installed. You can now run qBittorrent using the following command:
 qbittorrent

== Compiling qBittorrent (without the GUI; aka qBittorrent-nox aka headless) ==
First, obtain the qBittorrent source code.<br />
Either download and extract a .tar archive from [https://sourceforge.net/projects/qbittorrent/files/qbittorrent/ Sourceforge] or clone this git repo: <code>git clone https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent</code><br />
Enter the folder in a new terminal window and run:
 ./configure --disable-gui
 make -j2

* Note 1: If you're using libtorrent-rasterbar from the 0.16.x series, you also need to pass the <code>--with-libtorrent-rasterbar0.16</code> option to configure. qBittorrent v3.3.x has dropped the support of libtorrent 0.16.x.
* Note 2: If you want to compile with qt4 instead of qt5, you also need to pass the <code>--with-qt4</code> option to configure.
* Note 3: If you want to disable ALL authentication in the WebUI, change some lines as explained [https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/Disable-authentification-of-webGUI/ here].

And finally to install qBittorrent:
 sudo make install

That's it! qBittorrent-nox should now be installed. You can now run qBittorrent-nox using the following command:
 qbittorrent-nox

Since you disabled the graphical user interface, qBittorrent can only be controlled via its WebUI. If you haven't disabled authentication, as a default, you can access it at:
 http://localhost:8080
 Username: admin
 Password: adminadmin

A documentation about running qBittorrent without GUI is available [[Running-qBittorrent-without-X-server|here]].
