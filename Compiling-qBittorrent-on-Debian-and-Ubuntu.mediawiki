This how-to will guide you though the compilation of qBittorrent and libtorrent-rasterbar.<br />This guide is written for Ubuntu/Debian, but the process should be similar for other Linux distributions.<br /><br />Only follow this guide if you know what you are doing, and this is what you really want.<br />If you are looking only for the latest version of qBittorrent, just head to the download page and use our PPAs.

== Required dependencies ==
* General required dependencies
 sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-system-dev build-essential

* Qt4 libraries (optional and only if it exists in your distro's repo)
 sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev

* Qt5 libraries
 sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev-tools

* Python (Run time only dependency, for the search engine)
 sudo apt-get install python

== Optional dependencies ==

* Geoip Database (For peer country resolution, strongly advised)
 sudo apt-get install geoip-database

== Libtorrent ==
[http://libtorrent.org/ Libtorrent] is a library written by Arvid Norberg that qBittorrent depends on. It is necessary to compile and install libtorrent before compiling qBittorrent.
If your distro packages at least libtorrent 0.16.19 or 1.0.6 you can install it. Otherwise you'll need to compile it yourself.

If it exists in your distro's repos:
 sudo apt-get install libtorrent-rasterbar-dev

If you have to compile it:<br/>
First you'll need some extra dependencies to be installed:
 sudo apt-get install libboost-system-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-random-dev libssl-dev libgeoip-dev
And tools:
 sudo apt-get install git pkg-config automake libtool

Clone from the [https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent repo].
 git clone https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent.git
 cd libtorrent

If you want to use libtorrent 1.0.*. (Recommended)
 git checkout RC_1_0
 ./autotool.sh
 ./configure --disable-debug --enable-encryption --prefix=/usr --with-libgeoip=system

If you want to use libtorrent 1.1.*. (Note 1.1.x series are not officially supported yet. Read [https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/5888#issuecomment-257685779 this])
 git checkout RC_1_1
 ./autotool.sh
 ./configure --disable-debug --enable-encryption --prefix=/usr --with-libgeoip=system CXXFLAGS=-std=c++11

If you get a "configure: error: Boost.System library not found.", check if you installed all the above dependencies. <br/>If yes, add --with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu

Now you're ready to compile:
 make clean && make
 sudo make install

== Compiling qBittorrent (with the GUI) ==
First, obtain the qBittorrent source code. Either download and extract a .tar archive from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/qbittorrent/files/qbittorrent/ Sourceforge] or clone this git repo (<code>git clone https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent</code>).
<br />Enter the folder in a new terminal window and run:
 ./configure --prefix=/usr
 make

'''Note1''': If you're using libtorrent-rasterbar from the 0.16.x series, you also need to pass the "--with-libtorrent-rasterbar0.16" option to configure. qBittorrent v3.3.x has dropped the support of libtorrent 0.16.x.
<br />'''Note2''': If you want to compile with qt4 instead of qt5, you also need to pass the "--with-qt4" option to configure. 

And finally to install qBittorrent:
 sudo make install

That's it! qBittorrent should now be installed. You can now run qBittorrent using the following command:
 qbittorrent

== Compiling qBittorrent (without the GUI; aka qBittorrent-nox aka headless) ==
First, obtain the qBittorrent source code. Either download and extract a .tar archive from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/qbittorrent/files/qbittorrent/ Sourceforge] or clone this git repo (<code>git clone https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent</code>).
<br />Enter the folder in a new terminal window and run:
 ./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-gui
 make

'''Note1''': If you're using libtorrent-rasterbar from the 0.16.x series, you also need to pass the "--with-libtorrent-rasterbar0.16" option to configure. qBittorrent v3.3.x has dropped the support of libtorrent 0.16.x.
<br />'''Note2''': If you want to compile with qt4 instead of qt5, you also need to pass the "--with-qt4" option to configure.
<br />'''Note3''': If you want to disable ALL authentification on the WebGUI, change some lines as explained here: https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/Disable-authentification-of-webGUI/

And finally to install qBittorrent:
 sudo make install

That's it! qBittorrent-nox should now be installed. You can now run qBittorrent-nox using the following command:
 qbittorrent-nox

Since you disabled the graphical user interface, qBittorrent can only be controlled via its Web UI. If you haven' t disabled authentification, as a default, you can access it from:
 http://localhost:8080
 Username: admin
 Password: adminadmin

A documentation about running qBittorrent without GUI is available [[Running-qBittorrent-without-X-server|here]].
