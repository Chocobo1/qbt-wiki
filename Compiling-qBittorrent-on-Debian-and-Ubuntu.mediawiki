This How to will guide you though the compilation of qBittorrent and libtorrent-rasterbar.<br />This guide is written for Ubuntu/Debian but there shouldn't be much difference for other Linux distributions.<br /><br />Only follow the guide if you know what you are doing, and this is what you really want.<br />If you are looking only for the latest version of qBittorrent, just head to the download page and use our PPAs.

== Required dependencies ==
* General required dependencies
 sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-system-dev

* Qt4 libraries
 sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev

* Qt5 libraries (optional and only it it exists in your distro's repo)
 sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev

* Python (Run time only dependency, for the search engine)
 sudo apt-get install python

== Optional dependencies ==

* Geoip Database (For peer country resolution, strongly advised)
 sudo apt-get install geoip-database

== Libtorrent ==
[http://wwww.libtorrent.net Libtorrent] is a library written by Arvid Norberg that qBittorrent uses for the bittorrent part. It is necessary to compile and install libtorrent before compiling qBittorrent.
If your distro packages at least 0.16.19 or 1.0.6 you can install it. Otherwise you'll need to compile it yourself.
<br />If it exists in the repos:
 sudo apt-get install libtorrent-rasterbar-dev

If you have to compile it:
<br />First you should get a libtorrent-rasterbar release tarball. Go to [https://github.com/arvidn/libtorrent/releases this] page and download at least 1.0.6 (tar.gz format). Extract the sources and enter the folder from a terminal.
<br />First you'll need some extra dependencies to be installed:
 sudo apt-get install libboost-system-dev libssl-dev libgeoip-dev pkg-config

Now you're ready to compile:
 ./configure --disable-debug --prefix=/usr --with-geoip=system && make clean && make

if you get a "configure: error: Boost.System library not found.", try:
 ./configure --disable-debug --prefix=/usr --with-geoip=system --with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu && make clean && make

Then you can install libtorrent using the following commands:
 sudo make uninstall
 sudo make install-strip

For more information on building libtorrent, see [http://www.rasterbar.com/products/libtorrent/building.html libtorrent downloading and building]

== Compiling qBittorrent (with the GUI) ==
Now, let's get to the interesting part: compiling qBittorrent.
<br />Go to our website, download the sources and extract them to another folder.
<br />Quick link to our releases [http://sourceforge.net/projects/qbittorrent/files/qbittorrent/ here].
<br />Enter the folder from a terminal window.
<br />Or you can use the latest source from our git repo. You should know how to clone a git repo.
<br />Assuming you have entered the source folder:
 ./configure --prefix=/usr
 make

Note1: If you're using libtorrent-rasterbar from the 0.16.x series you need to pass to configure also "--with-libtorrent-rasterbar0.16". v3.3.x has dropped the support of 0.16.x.
<br />Note2: If you want to compile with qt5 instead of qt4 you need to pass to configure also "--with-qt5"

And to install it:
 sudo make install

That's it! qBittorrent should now be installed. You can now run qBittorrent using the following command:
 qbittorrent

== Compiling qBittorrent (without the GUI aka nox variant aka headless) ==
Now, let's get to the interesting part: compiling qBittorrent.
<br />Go to our website, download the sources and extract them to another folder.
<br />Quick link to our releases [http://sourceforge.net/projects/qbittorrent/files/qbittorrent/ here].
<br />Enter the folder from a terminal window.
<br />Or you can use the latest source from our git repo. You should know how to clone a git repo.
<br />Assuming you have entered the source folder:
 ./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-gui
 make

Note1: If you're using libtorrent-rasterbar from the 0.16.x series you need to pass to configure also "--with-libtorrent-rasterbar0.16". v3.3.x has dropped the support of 0.16.x.
<br />Note2: If you want to compile with qt5 instead of qt4 you need to pass to configure also "--with-qt5"

And to install it:
 sudo make install

That's it! qBittorrent should now be installed. You can now run qBittorrent using the following command:
 qbittorrent-nox

Since you disabled the graphical user interface, qBittorrent should be controlled via its Web UI. As a default, you can access it from:
 http://localhost:8080
 Username: admin
 Password: adminadmin

A documentation about running qBittorrent without GUI is available [[Running-qBittorrent-without-X-server|here]].
