This How to will guide you though the compilation of qBittorrent and libtorrent-rasterbar.<br />This guide is written for Ubuntu/Debian but there shouldn't be much difference for other Linux distributions.<br /><br />Only follow the guide if you know what you are doing, and this is what you really want.<br />If you are looking only for the latest version of qBittorrent, just head to the download page and use our PPAs.

== Required dependencies ==
* General build dependencies
 sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool automake autoconf subversion

* Boost and SSL libraries
 sudo apt-get install libboost-date-time-dev libboost-dev libboost-filesystem-dev \
 libboost-iostreams-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-regex-dev \
 libboost-serialization-dev libboost-signals-dev libboost-test-dev \
 libboost-thread-dev libssl-dev

* Qt5 libraries
Ubuntu:
 sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install qtdeclarative5-dev

Debian:
 sudo apt-get install qt5-default

* Python (Run time only dependency, for the search engine)
 sudo apt-get install python

== Optional dependencies ==

* Geoip Database (For peer country resolution, strongly advised)
 sudo apt-get install geoip-database

* Libnotify (for system notifications)
 sudo apt-get install libnotify-dev

== Compiling libtorrent ==
[http://wwww.libtorrent.net Libtorrent] is a library written by Arvid Norberg that qBittorrent uses for the bittorrent part. It is necessary to compile and install libtorrent before compiling qBittorrent.

First you should get libtorrent-rasterbar from SVN:
 mkdir -p qBittorrent_compiling
 cd qBittorrent_compiling

* Libtorrent v1.0.4
 svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/libtorrent/code/branches/RC_1_0/ libtorrent

You should now have the latest libtorrent svn branch in libtorrent/ folder. You will notice that there is no configure file provided. Hence, you must generate it yourself by issuing the following commands:
 cd libtorrent
 ./autotool.sh

Ok, Now you have a configure file, just type the following command:
 ./configure --disable-debug --prefix=/usr && make clean && make

if you get a "configure: error: Boost.System library not found.", try:
 ./configure --disable-debug --prefix=/usr --with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu && make clean && make


Then you can install libtorrent using the following commands:
 sudo make uninstall
 sudo make install-strip

== Compiling qBittorrent (with the Qt5 graphical interface) ==
Now, let's get to the interesting part: compiling qBittorrent.

Go back to qBittorrent_compiling/ folder and grab latest qBittorrent from GIT:
 cd ..
 git clone https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent.git

Ok, now let's compile it:
 cd qBittorrent
 ./configure --prefix=/usr
 make

And to install it:
 sudo make install

That's it! qBittorrent should now be installed. You can now run qBittorrent using the following command:
 qbittorrent

== Compiling qBittorrent (without the Qt5 graphical interface) ==
Now, let's get to the interesting part: compiling qBittorrent.

Go back to qBittorrent_compiling/ folder and grab latest qBittorrent from GIT:
 cd ..
 git clone https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent.git

Ok, now let's compile it:
 cd qBittorrent
 ./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-gui
 make

And to install it:
 sudo make install

That's it! qBittorrent should now be installed. You can now run qBittorrent using the following command:
 qbittorrent-nox

Since you disabled the graphical user interface, qBittorrent should be controlled via its Web UI. As a default, you can access it from:
 http://localhost:8080
 Username: admin
 Password: adminadmin

A documentation about running qBittorrent without GUI is available [[Running-qBittorrent-without-X-server|here]].
