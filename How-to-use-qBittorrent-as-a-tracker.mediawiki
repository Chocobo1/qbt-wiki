Since qBittorrent v2.5.0, qBittorrent ships a fully-functional tracker that allows you to share files with your friends way more easily.

== Enable the embedded tracker ==
qBittorrent's embedded tracker is disabled as a default to save resources. If you wish to use it, you need to enable it from the advanced preferences panel.

As a default, the tracker URL is:
http://your_public_ip:9000/announce

== Forward the tracker port on your router ==
If you want your tracker to be accessible from Internet (i.e. outside your LAN), you will probably have to configure your router to forward the tracker port to your machine (default: 9000).

Once you have configure your router, you can test that your configuration is working by:
* Running qBittorrent
* Enabling the embedded tracker
* Go to [http://www.canyouseeme.org/ http://www.canyouseeme.org/]:
** Type your tracker port (e.g. 9000)
** Press the "Check" button
* You should get a position result or this means that your router is not properly configured.
