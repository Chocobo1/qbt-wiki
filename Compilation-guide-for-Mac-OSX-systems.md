# Step One
Make sure your system is running the latest xcode build system with the commandline toolset.
# Step Two
Once you have ensured that you will want to install [macports](http://www.macports.org/install.php) (macports is a build system that compiles a lot of libraries and other software for Mac Operating Systems) as we will compile the necessary libraries needed for it, so you'll want to run sudo port install qt4-mac libtorrent-rasterbar and it will compile them. While that is compiling we will want to download the qBittorrent source code, which you can obtain from [qBittorrent's](http://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php) download page, extract the tarball and then download the [geoip dat](http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz) file and extract it to qbittorrents src/geoip folder
# Step Three
Once you have the pre-requesites compile you can run either command line via qmake qbittorrent.pro and then make or you can use qt creator. Once compiled you will want to run "sudo macdeployqt qbittorrent" or "sudo macdeployqt -dmg" (if you want to make a dmg installer for distribution)
